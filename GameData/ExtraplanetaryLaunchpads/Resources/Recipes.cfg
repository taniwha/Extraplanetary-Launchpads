	// LiquidFuel is assumed to be RP-1 which is further assumed to be C12H16

	// Oxidizer is assumed to be liquid oxygen (O2) and thus is 31.9988g/mol
	// MetalOre or is assumed to be hematite (Fe2O3) which is 159.6882g/mol
	//
	// The LiquidFuel + Oxidizer mix is assumed to be 2C12H16 + 17*O2 (this
	// gets pretty close to the correct volume ratios for RP-1+lox, and is
	// probably close enough for incomplete combustion).
	//
	// Metal is pure Iron (Fe), so 55.845g/mol, and carbon dioxid (CO2) is
	// 44.0095g/mol and water (H2O) 18.01528g/mol.
	//
	// This gives the following reaction:
	// 10Fe2O3 + 2C12H16 + 17O2 -> 20Fe + 24CO2 + 16H2O

	// to fudge the numbers such that the KSP resources are pulled in the
